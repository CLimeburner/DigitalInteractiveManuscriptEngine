# Digital Interactive Manuscript Engine (DIME)

**Artist's Statement**

Though often thought of as a more recent invention, interactive books have in fact been around since the medieval and early modern periods, appearing frequently alongside astronomical treatises, anatomy guides, and a whole host of other texts best illustrated with dynamic or explorable diagrams. However, it has remained an open question in the digital humanities of how best to represent these interactive diagrams in digital space. Without the coding background to build such interactives from the ground up, many scholars have turned to videos, animated GIFs, and when lucky, individually coded diagrams, but these methods largely fail to delivery on the experience of manipulating such a diagram for oneself. Consequently, the Digital Interactive Manuscript Engine (DIME) was undertaken as a project to provide a platform for fast and easy creation of such interactive diagrams, without the need for a background in coding.

Development of this project was carried out in conjunction with my CART 310 class, in which user research was carried out and progressive iterations of the platform were subjected to user testing. This research allowed me to identify features that were of highest priority to the target user base, and the resultant platform as it stands now can handle both simple rotational and translational manipulations of components, which covers a considerable number of applications, as demonstrated by demo diagrams created with the platform: 
Cipher wheels: https://climeburner.github.io/demo/CirculosDeMovimiento.html 
Planetary Motion: https://climeburner.github.io/demo/TheoricaMotus.html
Playing card suits: https://climeburner.github.io/demo/unicornvolvelle.html

Although in its current state, DIME is ready for public release as an open beta, the user research carried out also allowed me to identify a variety of further features that, while not part of the scope of this project, offer fruitful avenues for future elaboration of the platform. These include additional kinds of manipulations (flaps, strings, loose pieces), quality of life features (locking aspect ratio when scaling layers, parenting layers so that one follows another), and a parallel platform that can use machine vision to automatically segment 2D images into the respective layers needed to build the diagram. Given these factors, I anticipate work will continue on DIME well into the future.
